•	Questions

•	What is Webpack? 
Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications — it takes all the code from your application and makes it usable in a web browser. Modules are reusable chunks of code built from your app’s JavaScript, node_modules, images, and the CSS styles which are packaged to be easily used in your website. Webpack separates the code based on how it is used in your app, and with this modular breakdown of responsibilities, it becomes much easier to manage, debug, verify, and test your code.

•	What is a bundle in Webpack?
When Webpack processes your application, it builds a dependency graph which maps out the modules that your project needs and generates one or more bundles. A bundle is a distinct grouping of connected code that has been compiled and transformed for the browser.
If one file depends on another (it uses the code from a separate file), Webpack treats this as a dependency. Webpack also takes your non-code assets (images, fonts, styles, etc.) and converts them to dependencies for your application.
Webpack can be broken down into these 5 principals:
Entry
Output
Loaders
Plugins
Mode

•	What is the latest version of Webpack, according to this guide? Webpack 5

•	Which environment does Webpack work in? Development Mode  / Prod Mode

•	What is a dependency graph?
Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a dependency. This allows webpack to take non-code assets, such as images or web fonts, and also provide them as dependencies for your application.
When webpack processes your application, it starts from a list of modules defined on the command line or in its configuration file. Starting from these entry points, webpack recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often, just one - to be loaded by the browser.
Extra
Bundling your application is especially powerful for HTTP/1.1 clients, as it minimizes the number of times your app has to wait while the browser starts a new request. For HTTP/2, you can also use Code Splitting to achieve best results.

•	What is the name of the package manager that we use with Webpack 5?

•	How would you remove the lodash library using the command line? to use require / inmport for calling/ downloadipng dependency


•	What is the difference between source code and distribution code when working with Webpack 5?
Source code -> actual code
Distribution code -> compiled code 

•	When setting up your project, why might you adjust the package.json file?
Yes

•	what are optimization option ?  Name few ?
optimization.minimize - to minimize bundle file & by default uglify-js
optimization.minimizer - to provide which minimizer technique to use
optimization.splitChunks - The SplitChunksPlugin allows us to extract common dependencies into an existing entry chunk or an entirely new chunk. Always enabled.
optimization.runtimeChunkFinds modules which are shared between chunk and splits them into separate chunks to reduce duplication or separate vendor modules from application modules.
optimization.noEmitOnErrors - Enabled in production mode. Elsewise disabled. Don’t write output assets when compilation errors. unable to use working part of the application. And no broken bundles
optimization.namedModules - module names
optimization.namedChunks - chunks names 
optimization.moduleIds - 
optimization.chunkIds - 
optimization.nodeEnv - to set mode
optimization.mangleWasmImports
optimization.removeAvailableModules
optimization.removeEmptyChunks
optimization.mergeDuplicateChunks
optimization.flagIncludedChunks
optimization.occurrenceOrder
optimization.providedExports
optimization.usedExports
optimization.concatenateModules
optimization.sideEffects
optimization.portableRecords
optimization.mangleExports
optimization.innerGraph
optimization.realContentHash

• what is CommonsChunksPlugin?
The CommonsChunkPlugin was used to avoid duplicated dependencies across them, but further optimizations were not possible.Since webpack v4, the CommonsChunkPlugin was removed in favor of optimization.splitChunks.

•	What is Module path / Module Resolution ? 
A resolver is a library which helps in locating a module by its absolute path. A module can be required as a dependency from another module as:
The dependency module can be from the application code or a third-party library. The resolver helps webpack find the module code that needs to be included in the bundle for every such require/import statement. webpack uses enhanced-resolve to resolve file paths while bundling modules.

• Module paths
import 'module';
import 'module/lib/file';
Modules are searched for inside all directories specified in resolve.modules. You can replace the original module path by an alternate path by creating an alias for it using the resolve.alias configuration option.

•	what is MiniCssExtractPlugin?
This plugin extracts CSS into separate files. It creates a CSS file per JS file which contains CSS. It supports On-Demand-Loading of CSS and SourceMaps.

•	What is Dynamic Import in webpack?
The import(module) expression loads the module and returns a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all its exports. It can be called from any place in the code.

•	What is Split chunk cache ? TO DO

•	What is the difference between code splitting and modular programming?
Code splitting allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand. If used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.
Code splitting is one of the most compelling features of webpack. This feature allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritization which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.

There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

Entry Points: Manually split code using entry configuration.
Prevent Duplication: Use the SplitChunksPlugin to dedupe and split chunks.
Dynamic Imports: Split code via inline function calls within modules.

Moudular Programming :  Modules help developer’s separate functionality and organize the codebase. 

•	What is a code chunk? Chunk: This webpack-specific term is used internally to manage the bundling process. Bundles are composed out of chunks, of which there are several types (e.g. entry and child). Typically, chunks directly correspond with the output bundles however, there are some configurations that don't yield a one-to-one relationship.

•	How do dynamic imports differ from entry points? Can explain

•	How are preload directives preferable to prefetch directives? NOT NEEDED

•	What is meant by code linting? Code Linting - Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. This is done by using a lint tool (otherwise known as linter). A lint tool is a basic static code analyzer.

•	What is meant by the term promise? can Explain

•	How does SplitChunksPlugin prevent duplication?

•	What does the webpack-bundle-optimize-helper tool offer? 
This is a JavaScript library that reads a webpack stats.json file and gives back useful statistics about the file that helps the dev to reduce the bundle size.
What’s in the stats file?
As example of the stats file can be found inside the Bonsai repo itself right here.
The stats file contains full file paths, the file sizes, and the relationships between each of the modules in your project. The online Bonsai analyser reads this data locally in your browser and doesn’t upload anything.

•	What is treemapping / TreeShaking? Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript context for dead-code elimination. When we import and export modules in JavaScript, most of the time there is unused code floating around. Tree shaking or dead code elimination means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process.
Tools like webpack will detect dead code and mark it as “unused module” but it won’t remove the code. Webpack relies on minifiers to cleanup dead code, one of them is UglifyJS plugin, which will eliminate the dead code from the bundle.

•	what is asset management configurations? to make complete ready with loader & all..

•	What is HtmlWebpackPlugin?
This is a webpack plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply your own template using lodash templates or use your own loader.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin
